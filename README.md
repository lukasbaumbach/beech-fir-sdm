# INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND RUN THE CODE

To be able to properly run the code, please keep the same folder structure as present in the dropbox after downloading.
At the start of each code, the working directory will be set to the source location of the code file.

The code files are labelled from 01 to 04 and build on each other. 02 and 03 use almost the same files, for that reason they are stored in the same folder.

You might also have to download some packages first in order to run the code. All necessary packages are listed at the beginning of each code.

Have fun! :)
